        "speech":"Former R&D engineer during about 20 years. I have worked in different industries and been involved in a few major international projects. Despite my interest in this position, I fell the need to integrate an artistic side to my work. So I started a retraining in 2021 in order to become a game designer. Both technical and artistic aspects mixed in one role, the best position i could imagine ever. So here we are. I am gonna try to show you some of my creations. Thank you to take a look to my works. Additionnal contents will be available soon. Breaking news : Climb demo update is out.  :) Feel free to let constructive comments. Any advice is really welcome. Hito"
